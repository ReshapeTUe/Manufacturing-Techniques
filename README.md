# Manufacturing-Techniques
Context, explanation, and examples of manufacturing problems commonly found in soft robotics. 
This repository is related to the RoboSoft 2025 conference article "How to Mould, Bond, and Seal Soft Silicone: Practical Solutions to Common Problems". Each folder contains files relevant for the individual sections found in the article, and by following the instructions in the article the results can be replicated. 

In /SLA Resin Benchmark Moulds/, the .stl's of the benchmark moulds used in Section 2 of the article can be found.

In /Interfacing Components/, the .stl's of the connecting pieces with the lattice structures as well as the mould to insert them into are found. These are the same parts used for the experiments in Section 3 of the article.
